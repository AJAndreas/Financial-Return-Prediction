# Financial-Return-Prediction
This is a repository where I have researched the performance of various models on stock return prediction 

I was motivated to do this as I wanted to refamiliarise myself with various statistical and machine learning techniques while challenging myself to see if I could use my financial knowledge to make meaningful predictions. 

The first model I chose to use was CatBoost, as I have heard of its strong performance on tabular data and I wondered if this would translate to the financial domain with relatively little feature engineering. I used the AlphaVantage API to pull data and I chose to use some real estate stocks given where I am professionally in my career. 

To anyone wishing to use any of this code, please feel free. I am open to suggestions and always happy to discuss, so please shoot me a message if you would like to work together.
